### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m a young Java/Arduino developer from Germany. Java is my main programming language, but I also have some experience in C++, HTML, CSS and Javascript. IÂ´m interested in Cryptography, developing small applications,e.g. my visual sorting algorithm project, and writing algorithms to solve problems, like the one of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
